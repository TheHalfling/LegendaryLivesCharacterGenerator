Legendary Lives Character Generator

Legendary Lives is a Role-Playing game published in the 90s by Joe Williams & Kathleen Williams
The rules are currently available on http://hauntedattic.org/

This repository contains the files for a character generator.  When complete the goal is to have the python code develop the character data and port it to a pdf form for printing.  I plan to use this to generate pre-gen characters for use a gaming conventions.
